I tried to install make but it fails several times . So that's why I decided to write this file .
commands
  1. javac ReadFiles.java
  2. javac Scanner.java
  3. javac Main.java
  4. java Main

The output you can see in the result.txt file or also it will be appeared in the console . If you want to test the code
you just need to change program.txt to your favorable context.
